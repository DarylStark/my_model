Development
===========

Once you have a development environment, you can start coding. The library uses `poetry` for dependency manager. To add packages to the project, use the ``poetry add`` command. To removed packages from the project, use the ``poetry remove`` command. Publishing the package to PyPI can be done with ``poetry publish``. For more information, refer to the `Poetry documentation <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_.
