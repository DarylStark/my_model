"""Module that contains the class for a user scoped models.

This module contains the classes for models that are specific for a user, like
the User model itself and models that are created within the user namespace.
Examples for these models are API Tokens and Tags. To make sure we don't have
any code duplication, we use specific base classes: UserScopedModel for models
that are namespaced within a User and TokenModel for models that contain a
token of some sort.
